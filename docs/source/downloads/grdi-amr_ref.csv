This study examined the individual and combined roles of catecholate-iron and hydroxamate-iron transporters in the survival in meat of Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium. Catecholate–iron-III (Fe3þ) and hydroxamate-Fe3þ transporter genes fepA, iroN, and fhuACDB were deleted in isolates of these serovars to generate single, double, and triple mutants. Growth rate in high- and low-iron media was compared among mutants, complements, and their wild-type parents. Susceptibility to 14 antibiotics, the ability to produce and utilize siderophores, and survival on cooked chicken breast were evaluated. In iron-poor liquid media, differences were observed between the growth characteristics of mutant Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium. The double ΔiroNΔfepA and the triple ΔfhuΔiroNΔfepA mutants of Salmonella Enteritidis exhibited prolonged lag phases (λ ¼ 9.72 and 9.53 h) and a slow growth rate (μmax ¼ 0.35 and 0.25 hÀ1) similar to that of its ΔtonB mutant (λ ¼ 10.12 h and μmax ¼ 0.30 hÀ1). In Salmonella Typhimurium, double ΔiroNΔfepA and triple ΔfhuΔiroNΔfepA mutations induced a similar growth pattern as its ΔtonB mutant. Double deletions of fepA and iroN reduced the siderophore production and the use of enterobactin as an iron source. In the ΔiroNΔfepA mutant, but not in ΔfhuΔiroNΔfepA, the ferrichrome or deferrioxamine promoted growth for both serovars, conﬁrming the speciﬁc role of the FhuACDB system in the uptake and transport of hydroxamate Fe3þ. Survival of the mutants was also evaluated in a meat assay, and no difference in survival was observed among the mutants compared with wild type. This study showed differences between serovars in the importance of catecholate-iron and hydroxamate-iron uptake on Salmonella growth in iron-restricted media. Data also conﬁrmed that both Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium are well equipped to survive on cooked chicken meat, offering a rich iron condition.","2019-04-01","2020-04-23 14:23:16","2020-04-23 14:23:17","2020-04-23 14:23:16","548-560","","4","82","","","Growth of Salmonella enterica Serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis in Iron-Poor Media and in Meat","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Chekabab et al. - 2019 - Growth of Salmonella enterica Serovars Typhimurium.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study evaluated the efficacy of organic wild blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) also called low-bush blueberry pomace (LBBP)supplemented feed to modulate the chicken gut microbiota, and blood metabolites in order to improve bird health and productivity. Slow-growing broiler chickens were reared on pasture up to 64 D for sampling after 2 wk of treatment during brooding with 0, 1, and 2% LBBP in feed. Intestinal samples were collected at different time-points throughout the trial for bacterial culture and microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Blood sera were also analyzed for metabolites at each sampling time. Of the 14 bacterial phyla, the predominant taxa across all sampling time-points were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Tenericutes, representing >97% of all sequences. Bacteroidetes seemed to be replacing Firmicutes by LBBP supplementation, with the most noticeable effect at day 64 with 1% LBBP. LBBP inclusion enriched Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium, while Escherichia coli, Clostridium Clostridiaceae, Helicobacter, and Enterococcus showed higher abundances in control birds at the end of trial. Principal co-ordinate analysis showed a clear clustering of the intestinal samples from control and LBBP-treated groups at day 29. Application of LBBP resulted in a decrease (P < 0.05) in cholesterol at day 21, and an increase (P < 0.05) in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 14-day-old broilers. Higher (P < 0.05) levels of phosphorus, magnesium, and globulin at day 21 as well as iron and albumin at day 36 were also observed in 1% LBBP-fed birds. Despite limitations consisting essentially of low sampled birds for measurements, this study indicated that dietary supplementation of LBBP could positively influence gut microbiota and blood metabolites that may contribute to the overall health of pasture-raised broiler chickens.","2019-09","2020-04-23 14:23:20","2020-04-23 14:23:20","2020-04-23 14:23:20","3739-3755","","9","98","","Poultry Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Islam et al. - 2019 - Effects of wild blueberry ( Vaccinium angustifolium ) pomace feeding on gut microbiota and blood metabolites in fr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multifactorial condition, BRD encompasses several types of pneumonia that are associated with multiple viral and bacterial agents. Comprehensive identification of microbes associated with BRD fatalities could enhance our understanding of the range of pathogens that contribute to the disease and identify new therapeutic targets. This study used metagenomic analysis to describe the lower respiratory tract microbiome and resistome of 15 feedlot cattle BRD and 3 non-BRD mortalities along with any affiliated integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Known bacterial pathogens associated with BRD, including Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Mycoplasma bovis, were relatively abundant (> 5%) in most, but not all samples. Other relatively abundant genera (> 1%) included Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) comprised up to 0.5% of sequences and many of these genes were associated with ICEs previously described within the Pasteurellaceae family. A total of 20 putative ICEs were detected among 16 samples. These results document the wide diversity of microorganisms in the lower respiratory tract of cattle that have succumbed to BRD. The data also strongly suggest that antimicrobial-resistant Pasteurellaceae strains are prevalent in BRD cases in Alberta and that the resistance observed is associated with ICEs. The presence of ICEs harboring a wide array of ARGs holds significant consequence for the effectiveness of drug therapies for the control of BRD in beef cattle.","2019-08","2020-04-23 14:23:21","2020-04-23 14:23:21","2020-04-23 14:23:21","446-456","","2","78","","Microb Ecol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Klima et al. - 2019 - Lower Respiratory Tract Microbiome and Resistome of Bovine Respiratory Disease Mortalities.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our research team aimed to have a more complete understanding of antimicrobial resistance in Canada (IAM.AMR Project) using multiple methods including the literature reviews and quantitative modelling. To accomplish this goal, qualitative features of publications (e.g., geographical location, study population) describing potential relationships between the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and factors (e.g., antimicrobial use; management system) were of particular interest. The objectives of this review were to (a) describe the available peer‐reviewed literature reporting potential relationships between factors and antimicrobial resistance; and (b) to highlight data gaps. A comprehensive literature search and screening were performed to identify studies investigating factors potentially linked with antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter species, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica along the farm‐to‐fork pathway (farm, abattoir (slaughter houses) and retail meats) for the major Canadian livestock species (beef cattle, broiler chicken and pigs). The literature search returned 14,966 potentially relevant titles and abstracts. Following screening of titles, abstracts and full‐text articles, the qualitative features of retained studies (n = 28) were extracted. The most common factors identified were antimicrobial use (n = 13 studies) and type of farm management system (e.g., antibiotic‐free, organic; n = 8). Most studies were conducted outside of Canada and involved investigations at the farm level. Identified data gaps included the effect of vaccination, industry‐specific factors (e.g., livestock density) and factors at sites other than farm along the agri‐food chain. Further investigation of these factors and other relevant industry activities are needed for the development of quantitative models that aim to identify effective interventions to mitigate the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance along the agri‐food chain.","2018-12","2020-04-23 14:23:25","2020-04-23 14:23:25","2020-04-23 14:23:25","957-971","","8","65","","Zoonoses Public Health","Factors potentially linked with the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in selected bacteria from cattle, chickens and pigs","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Murphy et al. - 2018 - Factors potentially linked with the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in selected bacteria from cattle, chic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Viable enteric indicator or pathogenic bacteria in the biosolids were enumerated by plate count, gene targets associated with antibiotic resistance or horizontal gene transfer were detected by PCR, and a subset of these gene targets were quantiﬁed by qPCR. Following application at commercial rates to ﬁeld plots, the persistence of enteric bacteria and gene targets in soil was followed during the growing season. Carrots, radishes and lettuce were sown into the amended and unamended control plots, and the diversity and abundance of gene targets they carried at harvest determined. All three Class A biosolids carried fewer and less abundant antibiotic resistance genes than did the Class B biosolids, in particular the very alkaline N-Viro product (NRich).

A total of 95 enterococci from cloacal (n = 40), cecal (n = 38), and litter samples collected on day 36 (n = 17) were isolated weekly from day 7 to 36. All isolates were identiﬁed by API-20 Strep and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were evaluated using the Sensititre system with the plates for Gram positive bacteria. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to assess their intra- and inter-genetic variability, with a focus on virulence and antibiotic resistance characteristics. All isolates were further characterized for hemolysin production (HEM), bile salt hydrolysis (BSH), and gelatinase (GEL) activities. Of the 95 isolates, Enterococcus faecium (n = 58) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 24) were the most common Enterococcus species identiﬁed. Signiﬁcant differences in the level of resistance for the E. faecium isolates to ciproﬂoxacin, macrolide, penicillin and tetracycline were observed among treatments. The bcrR, mefA, and aac(6) genes were higher in BAM treatment than the other groups whereas bcrR, ermA, ermB, aphA(3), and tetL were more prevalent in PEN and BAC treatments. Overall, E. faecium isolates showed a higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, but E. faecalis from litter also exhibited a signiﬁcant level of resistance. A range of 4–15 different virulence genes was detected in E. faecalis. All isolates from litter but one (94.1%) showed BSH activities while 52.9% of them produced GEL. HEM activity was observed only in isolates collected on Day 7 (n = 9) and Day 14 (n = 1). This study conﬁrmed that genetically diverse AMR enterococci harboring virulence factors can be promoted by the use of certain antimicrobials in feed.

However, analysing plasmid content remains difficult due to incomplete assembly of plasmids. Bacterial isolates can contain any number of plasmids and assembly remains complicated due to the presence of repetitive elements. Numerous tools have been developed to analyse plasmids but the performance and functionality of the tools are variable. The MOB-suite was developed as a set of modular tools for reconstruction and typing of plasmids from draft assembly data to facilitate characterization of plasmids. Using a set of closed genomes with publicly available Illumina data, the MOB-suite identified contigs of plasmid origin with both high sensitivity and specificity (95 and 88 %, respectively). In comparison, plasmidfinder demonstrated high specificity (99 %) but limited sensitivity (50 %). Using the same dataset of 377 known plasmids, MOB-recon accurately reconstructed 207 plasmids so that they were assigned to a single grouping without other plasmid or chromosomal sequences, whereas plasmidSPAdes was only able to accurately reconstruct 102 plasmids.

Soil DNA was extracted and gene targets quantiﬁed by qPCR. Compared with untreated control soil, all 3 amendment types increased the abundance of gene targets for up to 4 years postapplication. The abundance of several gene targets was much higher in soil amended with SMC than in soil receiving either YWC or FWC. The gene target ermB remained higher in the SMC treatment for a decade postapplication. Clostridia were signiﬁcantly more abundant in the SMC-amended soil throughout the decade following application. Eight percent of Clostridium spp. isolates from the SMC treatment carried ermB. Overall, addition of organic amendments to soils has the potential to increase the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes.

Here, we characterized Escherichia coli from feedlot cattle feces and associated wastewater lagoons using CRISPR1 subtyping, and demonstrated that while generic E. coli were genetically diverse, populations were dominated by several ‘feedlotadapted’ CRISPR types (CTs) that were widely distributed throughout the feedlot. Moreover, E. coli bearing betalactamase genes, which confer reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporin's, predominantly belonged to these feedlot-adapted CTs. Remarkably, the genomic region containing the CRISPR1 allele was more frequently subject to genetic exchange among wastewater isolates compared to fecal isolates, implicating this region in environmental adaptation. This allele is proximal to the mutS-rpoS-nlpD region, which is involved in regulating recombination barriers and adaptive stress responses. There were no loss-of-function mutS or rpoS mutations or beneﬁcial accessory genes present within the mutS-rpoS-nlpD region that would account for increased environmental ﬁtness among feedlot-adapted isolates. However, comparative sequence analysis revealed that protein sequences within this region were conserved among most feedlot-adapted CTs, but not transient fecal CTs, and did not reﬂect phylogenetic relatedness, implying that adaptation to wastewater environments may be associated with genetic variation related to stress resistance. Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest adaptation of E. coli to feedlot environments may contribute to propagation of ARGs in wastewater lagoons.","2018-10","2020-04-23 14:23:41","2020-04-23 14:23:41","2020-04-23 14:23:41","657-664","","","637-638","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Tymensen et al. - 2018 - Clonal expansion of environmentally-adapted Escherichia coli contributes to propagation of antibiotic resistanc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although WGS data can be analyzed using a number of different approaches, such as traditional phylogenetic methods, a critical requirement for global systems for pathogen surveillance is the development of approaches for transforming sequence data into WGS-based subtypes, which creates a nomenclature that describes their higher-order relationships to one another. To this end, subtype similarity thresholds are needed to define clusters of subtypes representing lineages of interest. WGS-based subtyping presents a challenge since both the addition of novel genome sequences and small adjustments in similarity thresholds can have a dramatic impact on cluster composition and stability. We present the Neighbourhood Adjusted Wallace Coefficient (nAWC), a method for evaluating cluster stability based on computing cluster concordance between neighbouring similarity thresholds. The nAWC can be used to identify areas in in which distance thresholds produce robust clusters. Using datasets from             Salmonella enterica             and             Campylobacter jejuni             , representing strongly and weakly clonal bacterial species respectively, we show that clusters generated using such thresholds are both stable and reflect basic units in their overall population structure. Our results suggest that the nAWC could be useful for defining robust clusters compatible with nomenclatures for global WGS-based surveillance networks, which require stable clusters to be defined that both harness the discriminatory power of WGS data while allowing for long-term tracking of strains of interest.","2018-04-16","2020-04-23 14:23:49","2020-04-23 16:10:57","2020-04-23 14:23:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","preprint","bioRxiv","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/299347","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Barker et al. - 2018 - Rapid Identification of Stable Clusters in Bacterial Populations Using the Adjusted Wallace Coefficient.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once an illness cluster and a suspect food vehicle have been identiﬁed, food testing is initiated for conﬁrmation and to determine the scope of a contamination event so that the implicated lots may be removed from the marketplace. For biochemically diverse families of pathogens such as Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC), the ability to detect speciﬁc strains may be hampered by the lack of a universal selective enrichment approach for their recovery against high levels of background microbiota. The availability of whole genome sequence data for a given outbreak STEC strain prior to commencement of food testing may provide food microbiologists an opportunity to customize selective enrichment techniques favoring the recovery of the outbreak strain. Here we demonstrate the advantages of using the publicly available ResFinder tool in the analysis of STEC model strains belonging to serotypes O111 and O157 to determine antimicrobial resistance traits that can be used in formulating strain-speciﬁc enrichment media to enhance recovery of these strains from microbiologically complex food samples. The improved recovery from ground beef of model STEC strains with various antimicrobial resistance proﬁles was demonstrated using three classes of antibiotics as selective agents, suggesting the universal applicability of this new approach in supporting foodborne illness investigations.","2019-01-01","2020-04-23 14:23:51","2020-04-23 14:23:51","2020-04-23 14:23:51","39-44","","1","82","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Blais et al. - 2019 - Genomically Informed Strain-Specific Recovery of S.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of particular concern is the prophylactic use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, such as the medication of feeds with sulfonamides and other antibiotics not considered clinically relevant, but which may nonetheless co-select for multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria harboring resistance to medically important antibiotics. Using a MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae strain exhibiting resistance to sulfonamides and beta-lactams (including carbapenem) as a model, we examined the ability of non-medicated and commercially medicated (sulfonamide) animal feeds to select for the model strain when inoculated at low levels by measuring its recovery along with key AMR markers, sul1(sulfonamide) and blaKPC-3 (meropenem), under different incubation conditions. When non-medicated feeds were supplemented with deﬁned amounts of sulfadiazine the model strain was signiﬁcantly enriched after incubation in Mueller Hinton Broth at 37◦C overnight, or in same at room temperature for a week, with consistent detection of both the sul1 and blaKPC-3 markers as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to screen colony isolates recovered on plating media. Signiﬁcant recoveries of the inoculated strain and the sul1 and blaKPC-3 markers were observed with one of three commercially medicated (sulfamethazine) feeds tested under various incubation conditions. These results demonstrate that under certain conditions the prophylactic use of so-called non-priority antibiotics in feeds can potentially lead to co-selection of environmental AMR bacteria with resistance to medically important antibiotics, which may have far-reaching implications for human health.","2019-03-06","2020-04-23 14:23:53","2020-04-23 14:23:53","2020-04-23 14:23:53","456","","","10","","Front.

The ability to assess WGS data quality is critical to underpin the reliability of downstream analyses. Sequence contamination is a quality issue that could potentially impact WGS-based findings; however, existing tools do not readily identify contamination from closely-related organisms. To address this gap, we have developed a computational pipeline, ConFindr, for detection of intraspecies contamination. ConFindr determines the presence of contaminating sequences based on the identification of multiple alleles of core, single-copy, ribosomal-protein genes in raw sequencing reads. The performance of this tool was assessed using simulated and lab-generated Illumina short-read WGS data with varying levels of contamination (0–20% of reads) and varying genetic distance between the designated target and contaminant strains. Intraspecies and cross-species contamination was reliably detected in datasets containing 5% or more reads from a second, unrelated strain. ConFindr detected intraspecies contamination with higher sensitivity than existing tools, while also being able to automatically detect cross-species contamination with similar sensitivity. The implementation of ConFindr in quality-control pipelines will help to improve the reliability of WGS databases as well as the accuracy of downstream analyses.

Our ability to treat severe NTS infections has been impaired by increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To understand and mitigate the global health crisis AMR represents, we need to link the observed resistance phenotypes with their underlying genomic mechanisms. Broiler chickens represent a key reservoir and vector for NTS infections, but isolates from this setting have been characterized in only very low numbers relative to clinical isolates. In this study, we sequenced and assembled 97 genomes encompassing 7 serotypes isolated from broiler chicken in farms in British Columbia between 2005 and 2008. Through application of machine learning (ML) models to predict the observed AMR phenotype from this genomic data, we were able to generate highly (0.92 to 0.99) precise logistic regression models using known AMR gene annotations as features for 7 antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, and tetracycline). Similarly, we also trained “reference-free” k-merbased set-covering machine phenotypic prediction models (0.91 to 1.0 precision) for these antibiotics. By combining the inferred k-mers and logistic regression weights, we identiﬁed the primary drivers of AMR for the 7 studied antibiotics in these isolates. With our research representing one of the largest studies of a diverse set of NTS isolates from broiler chicken, we can thus conﬁrm that the AmpC-like CMY-2 ␤-lactamase is a primary driver of ␤-lactam resistance and that the phosphotransferases APH(6)-Id and APH(3Љ-Ib) are the principal drivers of streptomycin resistance in this important ecosystem.","2019-08-06","2020-04-23 15:52:13","2020-04-23 15:52:13","2020-04-23 15:52:13","e00211-19, /msystems/4/4/msys.00211-19.atom","","4","4","","mSystems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Maguire et al. - 2019 - Identification of Primary Antimicrobial Resistance 2.pdf","","","","Gilbert, Jack A.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Salmonella Heidelberg genomes had an average coverage of greater than 80-fold, an average of 4,761 protein-coding genes, and all belonged to multilocus sequence type ST15. Genome sequences were compared with genomes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Pathogen Detection database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/), including human outbreak isolates. The Canadian broiler isolates clustered with chicken isolates from the United States and an equine clinical isolate from Ontario, Canada. In agreement with their antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, several chromosomally encoded speciﬁc antimicrobial resistance genes including fosA7 and multidrug resistance efﬂux pump determinants were detected. An AmpC-like b-lactamase gene, blaCMY-2, linked with a quaternary ammonium compound resistance gene, sugE, on a replicon type IncI1 plasmid was detected in all 15 broiler Salmonella Heidelberg isolates. Of the 205,031 published Salmonella genomes screened in silico, 4,954 (2.4%) contained blaCMY-2, 8,143 (4.0%) contained fosA7, and 919 (0.4%) contained both resistance genes. The combination of both resistance genes (fosA7 and blaCMY-2) was detected in 64% of the Heidelberg genomes and in a small proportion of various other serovars. A PCR method was developed to detect Salmonella Heidelberg in pure culture and chicken feces based on speciﬁc primers targeting genes conferring fosfomycin (fosA7) and third-generation cephalosporin (blaCMY-2) resistance as well as the Salmonella-speciﬁc invA gene and the universal 16S rRNA genes. The PCR assay was speciﬁc and sensitive for blaCMY-2 and fosA7 harboring Salmonella Heidelberg. However, some other Salmonella serovars containing these two resistance genes could also be detected by the developed PCR method.","2019-11-01","2020-04-23 15:52:16","2020-04-23 15:52:16","2020-04-23 15:52:15","1938-1949","","11","82","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Rehman et al. - 2019 - Genome Analysis and Multiplex PCR Method for the M.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate the performance of existing bioinformatic tools for in silico prediction of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and serotypes of Salmonella enterica, WGS-based genotype predictions were compared with the results of traditional phenotyping assays. A total of 111 S. enterica isolates recovered from a Canadian baseline study on broiler chicken conducted in 20122013 were selected based on phenotypic resistance to 15 different antibiotics and isolates were subjected to WGS. Both SeqSero2 and SISTR accurately determined S. enterica serotypes, with full matches to laboratory results for 87.4 and 89.2% of isolates, respectively, and partial matches for the remaining isolates. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were identiﬁed using several bioinformatics tools including the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database – Resistance Gene Identiﬁer (CARDRGI), Center for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) ResFinder web tool, Short Read Sequence Typing for Bacterial Pathogens (SRST2 v 0.2.0), and k-mer alignment method (KMA v 1.17). All ARG identiﬁcation tools had ≥ 99% accuracy for predicting resistance to all antibiotics tested except streptomycin (accuracy 94.6%). Evaluation of ARG detection in assembled versus raw-read WGS data found minimal observable differences that were gene- and coverage- dependent. Where initial phenotypic results indicated isolates were sensitive, yet ARGs were detected, repeat AMR testing corrected discrepancies. All tools failed to ﬁnd resistance-determining genes for one gentamicinand two streptomycin-resistant isolates. Further investigation found a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the nuoF coding region of one of the isolates which may be responsible for the observed streptomycin-resistant phenotype. Overall, WGS-based predictions of AMR and serotype were highly concordant with phenotype determination regardless of computational approach used.","2020-04-03","2020-04-23 15:52:17","2020-04-23 15:52:17","2020-04-23 15:52:17","549","","","11","","Front.

This study used a three-dimensional structure-guided mutagenesis approach to demonstrate that PBPTET A6 is likely to be a class A penicillin-binding protein (PBP), and that its ability to confer cephalosporin resistance is directly linked to the functional integrity of its transpeptidase (TP) catalytic core. Screening of a library of PBPTET A6 variants carrying randomly introduced point mutations revealed additional residue modiﬁcations that compromised resistance, all of which were proximal to the TP active site except one which was found in a 29-amino-acid-long superstructure (α6-α7 loop) absent in other class A PBP homologues. Based on the site-speciﬁc mutagenesis results, it is hypothesized that residue arginine-400 plays an important role in limiting the access of certain cephalosporin compounds to the enzymatic core of the TP domain of PBPTET A6. Using a combination of adaptive evolution assays and whole-genome sequencing, the potential impact of PBPTET A6 on promoting the development of resistance in the clinically signiﬁcant opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. Under the selective pressure of serial ceftazidime exposures, the pbpTET A6expressing P. aeruginosa population readily evolved by excluding a ~400-kbp chromosomal element to acquire additional resistance against cephalosporins, suggesting that PBPTET A6 has a catalytic effect on facilitating antibiotic-resistance-associated genome adaptation. Overall, the soil environment contains genes conferring resistance to critically important antibiotics by cryptic mechanisms. Understanding what impact anthropogenic activities might have on the abundance and evolution of these genes should be a priority.","2020-03","2020-04-23 15:52:19","2020-04-23 15:52:19","2020-04-23 15:52:19","105896","","3","55","","International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","D:\OneDrive\Library\Lau et al. - 2020 - A penicillin-binding protein that can promote adva.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
